YASCBSH is an open source self-hosted music collection server and streamer. It gives you the freedom to listen to your
music collection from any browser or mobile device. It's like your personal Spotify!


**Note**: The `master` branch may be in an unstable or even broken state during development. 
Please use [releases](https://github.com/yascbsh/yascbsh/releases) instead of 
the `master` branch in order to get a stable set of binaries.

__Any feedback is welcome!__ If you need/want a new feature, find a bug or think of any way to improve YASCBSH,
please file a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/yascbsh/yascbsh/issues) or join the discussion in our
[officially supported, cloud-hosted solution](https://www.yascbsh.org/docs/installation/managed/#pikapods).

A share of the revenue helps fund the development of YASCBSH at no additional cost for you.
